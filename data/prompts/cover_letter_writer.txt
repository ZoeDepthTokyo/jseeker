3. Middle: One concrete achievement from the candidate. Connect it directly to their stated need. Use numbers if available.
4. Close: Cultural fit signal. Show you understand what they value. Clear, confident CTA.
5. NEVER use: "synergy", "leverage", "passionate", "excited to apply", "I am writing to express".
6. Tone must match: {culture_tone}
7. Language: {language}. If Spanish market (es/mx), write in professional Latin American Spanish.
