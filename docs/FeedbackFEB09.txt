Job seeker:
X:\Projects\jSeeker

// V1: addressed
ARGUS:
Memory State
Memory data unavailable: MNEMIS data directory not found
autorefresh 5 seconds
ARGUS dashboard still lists PROTEUS as component, But job seeker is project not a service.


PROTEUS align name change on UI, its JSEEKER.

FUTURE Desired functionality:
1. Extract Job Description from URL. If not possible, fallback to Copy paste.
2. Dashboard can intake several links, can generate several Resumes.

Current state:

Resume Library:
1. Resume library shows location of Resume on disk.
2. Front end edits work! Ensure they persist, (changes happen on back end)

Application tracker, is great
How does the Job status monitor work?

Job discovery:
Active Market tags dont work, they dont bring back results, dont get registered. 
Filter by status new does not show new jobs
Looks like search function is not working properly.

I need a section that shows which resumes are being referenced as base, A,B,C and LinkedIn Profile PDF,
this in case I need to update them or change, I can do that from the front end

Error:
Step 2/5: Matching resume templates...
Generation failed: No template matches found.
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "X:\Projects\jSeeker\ui\pages\2_new_resume.py", line 91, in <module>
    raise ValueError("No template matches found.")
ValueError: No template matches found.

also need better debug and TTD practices.

// v2: new:

Base Resume References
Track which source files are used as Base A/B/C and LinkedIn PDF.
Current Status:
base_a: Not configured
base_b: Not configured
base_c: Not configured
linkedin_pdf: Not configured
Base Resume A
Base Resume B
Base Resume C
LinkedIn Profile PDF
This whole section is empty. It should have the resumes loaded from:
"X:\Projects\jSeeker\docs\Resume References"
And all new custom created resumes here:
"X:\Projects\jSeeker\docs\Resume Library"
Application Tracker deleted previous tracker which was working well.

New resume module crashed:
ImportError: cannot import name 'extract_jd_from_url' from 'jseeker.jd_parser' (X:\Projects\jSeeker\jseeker\jd_parser.py)

In job discovery, search tags were deleted
TypeError: TrackerDB.list_discoveries() got an unexpected keyword argument 'search'
Traceback:
File "X:\Projects\jSeeker\ui\pages\5_job_discovery.py", line 126, in <module>
    discoveries = tracker_db.list_discoveries(status=status_value, search=search_query)
No active search tags. Add and activate tags first.

Overall thhis version is a massive regression many modules collapsed and a lot of previously registered info was deleted.
