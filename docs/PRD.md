# PROTEUS — The Shape-Shifting Resume Engine
## PRD v2.0 — GAIA Ecosystem Component

---

## Context

Federico has 15+ years of design leadership experience (Quetzal AI, Woven by Toyota, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Fantasy Interactive, Ronin X Design) with CES/Eyes on Design awards and MIT/Art Center education. Despite strong credentials, 250+ job applications have yielded 0 interviews.

**Root causes:**
- Resumes aren't optimized per-JD for ATS keyword matching
- Manual adaptation across 3 template variants (A/B/C) is too slow
- Two-column formatting is time-consuming to finesse in doc apps
- No feedback loop to learn what works
- No recruiter outreach automation
- No dynamic tracking of job opportunity status (active/closed/expired)

**Goal:** A GAIA-integrated Streamlit product that takes a pasted JD, adapts structured resume blocks from 3 master templates, scores ATS compliance per platform, renders PDF + DOCX, generates recruiter outreach, and tracks applications with live job/resume/application status — all in under 1 minute per application.

**Name origin:** Proteus — Greek sea god who could shift his form to match any situation, yet always remained himself. Like the resume: the core truth of 15 years of experience stays constant, but the presentation adapts to each opportunity.

## GAIA ↔ PROTEUS Symbiosis

### How PROTEUS benefits from GAIA

| GAIA Component | Benefit to PROTEUS |
|---|---|
| **MYCEL** | LLM abstraction — switch Anthropic/OpenAI/Gemini without code changes. Centralized API keys via GaiaSettings. Cache infrastructure. |
| **ARGUS** | Monitors generation quality, cost drift, ATS score trends over time. Alerts if spend exceeds budget. |
| **MNEMIS** | Stores proven resume patterns (what blocks + phrasing → interviews). Remembers per-company preferences. |
| **Mental Models** | Enhances JD analysis (e.g., "Systems Thinking" to evaluate org culture, "First Principles" for role decomposition). |
| **VULCAN** | Instant project scaffolding via Processor adapter. Auto-generates CLAUDE.md. |
| **Registry** | Central discoverability. Other GAIA tools can query PROTEUS data. |

### How GAIA benefits from PROTEUS

| Benefit | Detail |
|---|---|
| **New product category** | Validates GAIA for personal productivity tools, not just AI/ML infrastructure |
| **Structured data generation** | JD parsing creates company intelligence, skills taxonomies, market salary data that enriches GAIA knowledge |
| **Behavioral intelligence** | Resume performance data (which patterns → interviews) feeds MNEMIS with real-world human behavioral signals |
| **Adapter validation** | Tests the Processor adapter pattern for document-generation products |
| **Cross-component stress test** | Real product with real stakes exercises MYCEL→MNEMIS→ARGUS bridges in production |
| **User-facing proof** | Demonstrates GAIA can produce end-user products, not just developer tools |

## ATS Platform Intelligence

### Top Platforms by Market Share (2026)

| Platform | Used By | Market Position | Key Behavior |
|----------|---------|----------------|--------------|
| **Workday** | Amazon, Walmart, Target, large enterprise | Market leader | Strict keyword matching, exact title matches, standard headers mandatory |
| **Greenhouse** | Airbnb, Pinterest, HubSpot, mid-large tech | Strong #2 | Modern parsing, handles PDFs well, quantified results valued |
| **Lever** | Netflix, Spotify, Eventbrite | Growth player | Forgiving parser, good with clean formatting |
| **iCIMS** | Enterprise/healthcare/finance | Legacy leader | Struggles with columns, needs simplest format |
| **Ashby** | YC startups, high-growth tech | Rising fast | Modern parser, startup-friendly |
| **Taleo** (Oracle) | Legacy enterprise, government | Declining | Most restrictive parser, single-column only |

### Universal ATS Rules (baked into renderer)
- Standard section headers only: "Summary", "Experience", "Education", "Skills", "Awards"
- MM/YYYY date format consistently
- Standard fonts: Arial, Calibri, Times New Roman (10-12pt)
- No floating text boxes, sidebars as images, nested tables, icons, or graphics
- Simple bullet points (hyphens or circles)
- Action verb + quantified metric bullet structure

### Two-Column Strategy
- **PDF (human-facing)**: Two-column CSS Grid — visually impressive for recruiter eyes
- **DOCX (ATS-facing)**: Single-column linearized layout for maximum ATS compatibility
- Both generated from the same structured data, different templates
- App recommends format based on detected ATS platform

## GAIA Integration

### Registry Entry
```json
{
  "proteus": {
    "name": "PROTEUS - The Shape-Shifting Resume Engine",
    "gaia_role": "Automated resume adaptation, ATS optimization, recruiter outreach, and application tracking",
    "path": "X:/Projects/_GAIA/_PROTEUS",
    "version": "0.1.0",
    "status": "development",
    "git": true,
    "python": "3.10+",
    "framework": "streamlit",
    "providers": ["anthropic"],
    "depends_on": ["mycel"],
    "tags": ["gaia-product", "resume", "ats", "job-search", "automation", "document-generation"]
  }
}
```

### MYCEL Integration
- `config.py` inherits from `GaiaSettings` (provides API keys, cache settings, gaia_root)
- LLM calls routed through `create_llm_client()` from `rag_intelligence`
- Prompt caching via MYCEL's cache infrastructure

### ARGUS Telemetry
- Log resume generations, ATS scores, API costs to `X:\Projects\_GAIA\logs\`
- Monitor generation quality and spend drift

### MNEMIS (Phase 3+)
- Store successful resume patterns (high ATS scores → interviews) in PROJECT tier memory
- Promote proven patterns to GAIA tier for cross-project reuse

## Core Workflow — "JD to Resume in 1 Minute"

### Step 0: Job Discovery (background / on-demand)
- **Tag-based web search**: User defines search tags (e.g., "Director of Product", "Lead Product Design", "UX Director", "Lead UX Designer", "Senior Product Manager AI")
- PROTEUS searches job boards (LinkedIn Jobs, Greenhouse boards, Lever boards, Wellfound/AngelList, Indeed) via `requests` + BeautifulSoup
- Returns list of matching jobs: title, company, location, salary (if posted), URL, posting date
- User can star/dismiss results → starred jobs get auto-imported into tracker with `job_status: active`
- **Configurable frequency**: on-demand button OR scheduled interval (daily check via a simple Python scheduler)
- Stored in `job_discoveries` SQLite table with deduplication by URL

### Step 1: JD Input (5 sec)
- **Simple paste**: Large text area — user copies JD text from any source (or clicks "Import" from a discovered job)
- **Auto-prune** (Haiku $0.001): Strip boilerplate ("We are an equal opportunity employer...", benefits sections, legal disclaimers, company overview paragraphs) — keep only role-relevant content
- Show pruned result for quick confirmation

### Step 2: JD Analysis (10 sec, Haiku $0.003)
- Parse → `ParsedJD`: title, company, seniority, hard/soft requirements, ATS keywords, culture signals
- User can optionally input the job URL → auto-detect ATS platform from domain
- Show parsed result for user confirmation/edit

### Step 3: Template Matching (10 sec, Sonnet $0.024)
- Score all 3 templates (A/B/C) against JD requirements
- Show top recommendation with relevance % and gap analysis
- User confirms or overrides template selection
- Option: "Blend" — combine blocks from multiple templates

### Step 4: Content Adaptation (20 sec, Sonnet $0.046)
- Rewrite summary to mirror JD language (3-4 lines, preserve key metrics)
- Adapt 3-5 bullets per experience using JD keywords naturally
- Reorder skills to prioritize JD matches
- Frame adjacent experience for gap coverage
- Include online presence links (website, LinkedIn) in contact section
- Apply learned user preferences from `preferences.json`

### Step 5: ATS Scoring (5 sec, local + Haiku $0.004)
- **Platform-specific scoring** using rules from `data/ats_profiles/`
- Keyword match rate, format compliance, section presence, bullet structure
- Output: score 0-100, matched/missing keywords, platform-specific warnings
- Recommend PDF vs DOCX based on detected ATS platform

### Step 6: Preview & Export (5 sec)
- Side-by-side: rendered resume preview + ATS score card
- Highlighted keywords (green = matched, red = missing)
- **Export buttons**: PDF (two-column visual), DOCX (single-column ATS-safe), or both
- **Save to tracker** with company, role, status → auto-sets resume status to "generated"

### Step 7: Recruiter Outreach (5 sec, Haiku $0.003)
- Input: recruiter name/email (from JD or user input)
- **Web search** (via `requests` + search API or manual): find recruiter on LinkedIn for the company/role
- Generate short personalized outreach message (email or LinkedIn DM)
- Tone: professional, concise, references specific JD requirements matched
- Save outreach + recruiter email/LinkedIn alongside resume in tracker

### Step 8: Dashboard Review
- After export + save, user lands on the **application dashboard** showing:
  - This application's card: company, role, ATS score, resume status, application status, job status
  - Side panel: generated resume preview, outreach message, recruiter info
  - Quick actions: "Mark as Applied", "Send Outreach", "Edit Resume", "Check Job Status"
  - At-a-glance metrics: total active applications, avg ATS score, applications this week, cost this month
- Dashboard is also the **home page** of the app — always shows the full pipeline

**Total time: ~1 minute. Total cost: ~$0.09/resume.**

## Dynamic Status Tracking — 3 Independent Pipelines

### 1. Resume Status
Tracks the lifecycle of each generated resume document.

```
draft → generated → edited → exported → submitted
```

| Status | Trigger |
|--------|---------|
| `draft` | User starts new resume wizard but hasn't generated yet |
| `generated` | PROTEUS produces adapted content |
| `edited` | User modifies content in editor |
| `exported` | PDF/DOCX files downloaded |
| `submitted` | User confirms they uploaded/emailed the resume |

### 2. Application Status
Tracks the candidate's progress through the hiring pipeline.

```
not_applied → applied → screening → phone_screen → interview → [offer | rejected | ghosted | withdrawn]
```

| Status | Trigger |
|--------|---------|
| `not_applied` | Application created but resume not yet submitted |
| `applied` | User marks as submitted |
| `screening` | Received acknowledgment or moved to review |
| `phone_screen` | Recruiter call scheduled or completed |
| `interview` | Formal interview (on-site/video) |
| `offer` | Received offer |
| `rejected` | Explicit rejection received |
| `ghosted` | No response after 2+ weeks (auto-detected by tracker) |
| `withdrawn` | User withdraws application |

### 3. Job Opportunity Status (via URL monitoring)
Tracks whether the job posting itself is still active.

```
active → closed → expired → reposted
```

| Status | Detection Method |
|--------|-----------------|
| `active` | JD URL returns 200 with job content |
| `closed` | URL returns 404 or "position filled" text |
| `expired` | URL returns "no longer accepting" or posting date > 60 days |
| `reposted` | URL content changed significantly (new posting date or modified requirements) |

**`proteus/job_monitor.py`**: Periodic URL checker (user-triggered or scheduled) that:
- Fetches each tracked JD URL
- Checks HTTP status + page content for closure signals
- Updates job_opportunity_status in SQLite
- Flags reposted jobs for potential re-application with updated resume

- Agent B (senior-python-ml-engineer): `data/resume_blocks/*.yaml` (populate from all templates)
- Agent C (doc-updater): `CLAUDE.md` + `docs/PRD.md` + registry entry

**Wave 2 — Core Logic (parallel, after Wave 1):**
- Agent D (senior-python-ml-engineer): `proteus/jd_parser.py` + `proteus/matcher.py`
- Agent E (senior-python-ml-engineer): `proteus/adapter.py` + `proteus/ats_scorer.py`
- Agent F (senior-python-ml-engineer): `proteus/renderer.py` + `data/templates/`

**Wave 3 — Features (parallel, after Wave 2):**
- Agent G (senior-python-ml-engineer): `proteus/outreach.py` + `proteus/tracker.py` + `proteus/job_monitor.py` + `proteus/job_discovery.py`
- Agent H (ux-design-lead): `ui/app.py` + `ui/pages/1_dashboard.py` + `ui/pages/2_new_resume.py` + `ui/pages/4_tracker.py` + `ui/pages/5_job_discovery.py`
- Agent I (tdd-guide): `tests/` (all test files)

**Wave 4 — Validation (sequential):**
- Agent J (code-reviewer): Review all code
- Agent K (security-reviewer): Check for API key leaks, prompt injection
- Agent L (build-error-resolver): Run tests, fix failures
- Integration testing: 5 real JDs end-to-end

### MCP Connections
- **Context7** (`mcp__plugin_context7_context7`): Look up Streamlit, Playwright, python-docx, Anthropic SDK docs
- **Pinecone** (`mcp__plugin_pinecone_pinecone`): Phase 3+ for semantic resume block search
- **Greptile** (`mcp__plugin_greptile_greptile`): PR reviews when pushing PROTEUS code

### WebSearch Tool
WebSearch is available in the Claude Code development environment (used during planning for ATS research). **Not available at app runtime** — the app uses:
- `requests` + `BeautifulSoup` for URL scraping (JD pages)
- `requests` for job URL monitoring (HTTP status checks)
- For recruiter LinkedIn lookup: the app generates a formatted search query that the user can run, OR uses the Anthropic API's web search capability if available in the SDK version

### Claude API Models (Runtime — inside the app)

| Task | Model | Est. Cost/call | Rationale |
|------|-------|---------------|-----------|
| JD pruning | claude-haiku-4-5 | $0.001 | Strip boilerplate |
| JD parsing | claude-haiku-4-5 | $0.003 | Structured extraction |
| Keyword extraction | claude-haiku-4-5 | $0.002 | Simple NLP task |
| Block relevance scoring | claude-sonnet-4-5 | $0.024 | Needs reasoning about fit |
| Summary rewriting | claude-sonnet-4-5 | $0.011 | Quality writing needed |
| Bullet adaptation (batched) | claude-sonnet-4-5 | $0.036 | Most important output |
| ATS scoring | claude-haiku-4-5 | $0.004 | Checklist evaluation |
| Outreach message | claude-haiku-4-5 | $0.003 | Short templated message |
| Recruiter search query | claude-haiku-4-5 | $0.001 | Query formulation |

**Total per resume + outreach: ~$0.09** → ~55-110 resumes/month on $5-10 budget

### Prompt Caching Strategy
- Resume block corpus (~4-5K tokens) in system prompt with `cache_control: {"type": "ephemeral"}`
- First call in session: full price. Subsequent calls within 5 min: 90% discount on cached tokens
- Typical session (3-5 resumes): saves ~$0.03-0.05 total
- Local SHA256 file cache for identical prompt+response pairs

---

## Rendering Strategy

### PDF — Two-Column Visual (Playwright + CSS Grid)
```css
@page { size: Letter; margin: 0.5in; }
.resume-grid {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: 2.2in 1fr;
    gap: 0.3in;
    font-family: 'Calibri', 'Arial', sans-serif;
    font-size: 9.5pt;
    line-height: 1.35;
}
.left-column { /* contact + links, skills, education, certifications, awards */ }
.right-column { /* name/title header, summary, experience */ }
```
- Jinja2 HTML template → Playwright Chromium → PDF
- Pixel-perfect two-column with full CSS control
- Includes website + LinkedIn links in contact section
- For human recruiters and Greenhouse/Lever/Ashby (modern ATS)

### DOCX — Single-Column ATS-Safe (python-docx)
- Linear single-column layout, no tables
- Standard headers, standard fonts (Calibri 11pt)
- Maximum ATS compatibility for Workday/iCIMS/Taleo
- Generated from same structured data, different template

### Template Selection Logic
```python
def recommend_format(ats_platform: str) -> dict:
    if ats_platform in ("workday", "icims", "taleo"):
        return {"primary": "docx", "reason": "This ATS parses DOCX single-column best"}
    elif ats_platform in ("greenhouse", "lever", "ashby"):
        return {"primary": "pdf", "reason": "Modern ATS handles PDF two-column well"}
    else:
        return {"primary": "both", "reason": "Unknown ATS — submit DOCX for safety"}
```

## Feedback/Learning System

1. Store "original" generated resume on creation
2. On user save, diff original vs. edited → categorize changes
3. Store events in `feedback_events` SQLite table
4. After 5+ edits, detect patterns via heuristics
5. Inject preferences into Claude prompts as rules
6. Monthly Haiku call to synthesize patterns ($0.005)

---

## Documentation Strategy

- **`docs/PRD.md`** — This document. Versioned (v1.0, v2.0, ...). Append changelog, don't overwrite history.
- **`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`** — Technical deep-dive: module interactions, data flow diagrams, API call sequences
- **`docs/USER_GUIDE.md`** — How to use the Streamlit app. Screenshots when available.
- **`docs/ATS_RESEARCH.md`** — All ATS platform research, scoring rules rationale, sources
- **`docs/CHANGELOG.md`** — Every version bump with what changed
- All docs reviewed before user testing delivery

---

## Verification Plan (Phase 1 — before user testing)

### Unit Tests (pytest)
- `test_jd_parser.py`: Parse 3 real JD texts, verify ParsedJD fields; test auto-pruning
- `test_matcher.py`: Score blocks against known JD, verify template A/B/C ranking
- `test_adapter.py`: Verify adapted summary contains JD keywords without hallucinating experience
- `test_ats_scorer.py`: Score a known-good resume, verify score > 85; score a bad one, verify < 50
- `test_renderer.py`: Generate PDF + DOCX, verify files exist and are > 10KB
- `test_outreach.py`: Generate outreach message, verify it's < 500 chars and contains role title
- `test_tracker.py`: CRUD operations on SQLite, 3-pipeline status transitions

### Integration Tests
- **End-to-end**: Paste real Waymo JD → get PDF + DOCX + outreach → verify all outputs valid
- **ATS platform detection**: Test 5 URLs from different platforms
- **Cost tracking**: After 5 test generations, verify cumulative API cost matches budget model ($0.45)
- **Job monitor**: Test URL status detection with a known-closed posting

### Visual Verification
- Open generated PDF side-by-side with existing Resume A — compare layout
- Open generated DOCX — verify single-column, no artifacts
- Upload DOCX to free ATS checker (jobscan.co) — verify score > 80

### Stress Test
- Generate 10 resumes in sequence — verify caching, no memory leaks, no SQLite locks

---

## Execution Protocol (Post-Approval)

Upon plan approval:
1. **Auto-accept** all tool permissions (Bash, Edit, Write, Task, Grep, Glob, Read)
2. **ARGUS live monitoring**: Write build progress to `X:\Projects\_GAIA\logs\proteus_build.jsonl` — each agent logs:
   - `{"timestamp", "agent", "wave", "file", "status": "started|completed|failed", "details"}`
   - ARGUS dashboard can tail this log for live build visibility
3. Launch **parallel agent waves** as described in Agent Execution Plan
4. Each agent creates its files, runs its tests, logs to ARGUS
5. Documentation generated alongside code (not after)
6. Version PRD: append changes to docs/PRD.md, increment version
7. All code reviewed by code-reviewer agent before declaring Phase 1 complete
8. Run full test suite, fix all failures
9. Deliver app for user testing with `streamlit run ui/app.py`

### ARGUS Build Monitor Integration
- Build telemetry written as JSONL to `X:\Projects\_GAIA\logs\proteus_build.jsonl`
- Each log entry: `{"ts": "ISO8601", "agent": "name", "wave": 1-4, "module": "file.py", "status": "started|completed|error", "duration_ms": N, "details": "..."}`
- ARGUS can display: which agents are active, what wave we're in, which modules are done, any errors
- On build completion: summary entry with total files created, tests passed/failed, total build time

## Version History

### v0.3.8 (Feb 15, 2026) — User Feedback Round (6 fixes)
**High Priority Fixes:**
1. **Company name extraction** (Santander) — Added "At Company, we..." pattern fallback + 9 test cases
2. **Location detection** (Mexico City) — 60-city location-to-market mapping, Spanish language auto-switch for Mexico/LATAM jobs
3. **Output folder/file naming** — Placeholder detection ("Not specified" → "Unknown_Company"), real company names flow through correctly

**Medium Priority:**
4. **Learning Insights pattern context** — Domain classification (UX/Design, Product, Engineering, Data/ML, Leadership, General) replaces confusing role-only display

**Low Priority:**
5. **Salary Analytics visualization** — Job Market Distribution by region (bar + radar charts) for US, MEX, CA, UK, EU, LATAM, ASIA
6. **Pattern Schema UI** — Real pattern data with expandable details (top 20), documented schema, field explanations

**Team approach:** 6 parallel agents with file ownership to avoid conflicts, TDD methodology (tests first), CI/CD validation
**Test results:** 435/437 passing (99.5%), 2 pre-existing known failures (French lang detection, perf boundary)
**Files modified:** 11 files (jd_parser, renderer, pattern_learner, 7_learning_insights, test files)
**New tests added:** 26 tests (14 market detection, 12 language detection, 2 company extraction, 2 output naming)

### v0.3.8.1 (Feb 15, 2026) — Critical Hotfix (4 regressions)
**Why regressions occurred:** Tests used fresh fixtures without old schema data, no backwards compatibility testing, UI layer gaps

**Critical Fixes:**
1. **pdf_validation AttributeError** — Reordered PDFValidationResult class before PipelineResult (forward ref), added defensive getattr() in UI, +3 backwards compat tests
2. **Domain column KeyError** — Added try/except for malformed JSON parsing + defensive DataFrame column checks for old patterns without 'domain' field
3. **Fetch JD button not working** — Fixed Streamlit widget key conflict using intermediate key pattern (temp key → rerun → widget key transfer)
4. **Viterbit.site parser** — Added Playwright-based extraction for JS-rendered sites (403 on plain HTTP), subdomain company extraction

**Learnings applied (added to CLAUDE.md):**
- Always use Optional[] for new model fields + defensive access (getattr/hasattr)
- Check DataFrame column existence before operations: `if "col" not in df.columns`
- Wrap JSON parsing in try/except for old DB data
- Define dependent Pydantic models before usage (class order matters)
- Streamlit widget keys: use intermediate session state to avoid conflicts
- Need backwards compatibility tests with old schemas

**Team:** 3 agents (domain-fixer, validation-fixer, fetch-button-fixer), 8 files, 4 tests added, ~180 lines modified
**Test results:** 439/440 passing (99.77%), only failure is pre-existing French language detection
**Documentation:** Comprehensive HOTFIX_v0.3.8.1.md + CLAUDE.md updated with 6 critical gotchas
