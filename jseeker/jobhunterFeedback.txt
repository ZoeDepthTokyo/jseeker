Performance is really slow. 
Good architecture poor UX. Too many clicks and steps for user.
Current: Analyze JD ->(click) Match template ->(click) Adapt resume->(click) Score Compliance ->(click) Export pdf and doc

Instead user should:
Analyze JD ->(click) Receive pdf and doc ready for export.
(back end still goes through the whole chain Analyze JD, Match template, Adapt resume, Score Compliance and Export pdf and doc)

Output for user
Is traceability of all steps and results, seeing the output of each step is good.

Currently no new resume creation gets saved, there is no way to see history or go back to a resume version. Ask me how this should work and what nomenclature files should have. All Resumes should be saved to a local database, and I should be able to delete or re export them from the front end UI.

too much vertical scrolling, create scrollable containers, expandible and collapsible windows.

Wasnt there a GAIA module that focused on good UX and UI design? why isnt that agent being called? 

The Resume creation is referencing Resume A,B,C but not the LinkedIn full version so its missing a lot of details and data. like education and other jobs.

The PDF ouput format is visually unusable, while all the data is there, it created it with its own font, its own spacing and terrible type layout, DONT WE HAVE A DESIGN AGENT to take care of this?

There is now way to indicate output folder and name of folder. 
There is no way to inidicate output file name.

Resume doc x is better, but format is not following previously stated standards so it creates a vertically long resume. Look at "C:\Users\Fede\Downloads\Federico_Ponce_Manager – Human Interface Design, Commercial GM.docx (1).pdf" for layout and formatting as reference.

Why did you add a manual tracker? 
The application tracker does not have editable column values. If I applied, there is no way to change status

Job discovery works really well. Can you extract and sort by date posted.

API cost is not being tracked. 
When new resume is created it should be added to tracker
tracker needs to have a URL column 
currently there are only three job boards available, there should be more, and 
the scan should discard redundant postings and give preference to linked in platform

relevance score in the application tracker is not registering percentage.


once approved match flow to tasks so that you dont miss any tasks
assign sub agents to complete all tasks
use GAIA framework 


User-confirmed preferences:

File naming: Fede_Ponce_{role}_{company}.{ext} (from contact.yaml display_name)
Folder structure: output/{company}/Fede_Ponce_{role}_v{N}.pdf
Versioning: Keep all versions, mark latest, allow manual deletion
But allow user to EDIT.

in plain text generate user flow for all modules. and mermaid charts to confirm UX and output flows

enlgish and spanish language, auto detect what language to use from Job description language.
